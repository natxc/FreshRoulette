# FreshRoulette

Luckily, my years of working in data have kept me well-equipped to scrape data, transform it, model it, use it, you name it! Thus, gathering recipes for this project came easily. The rest was pretty fun, too. I got to combine front-end design with back-end principles for an app that solves a weekly problem.
